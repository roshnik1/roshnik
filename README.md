## Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Waving%20Hand.png" alt="Waving Hand" width="28" height="28" />

I'm **Roshni**, a passionate developer primarily interested in **full-stack development**. 🚀 From crafting sleek user interfaces to designing robust backend systems, I thrive on building complete and impactful solutions.

When I’m not coding, you can find me:
- 📚 Getting lost in the pages of a great book
- 🏃‍♂️ Enjoying invigorating runs through picturesque trails
- 🏞️ Hiking and soaking in the breathtaking beauty of Colorado's landscapes

These activities fuel my creativity and keep me inspired, blending adventure with a love for continuous learning 🌐

I’m always excited to explore new technologies and frameworks that can elevate the development process and enhance user experiences. Feel free to reach out if you’re up for a chat about full-stack development, want to collaborate on a project, or just wish to share intriguing tech news.
